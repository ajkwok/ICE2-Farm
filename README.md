properly exercised

The contructors of each animal will need color, how many times a day it needs to be fed, how many times a week it needs to be washed, and how many hours of exercise a week.

In addition, the cow will need to be milked x times a week, pigs will playy in the mud x times a week, chickens will lay x amount of eggs a week, sheep will be sheared x times a month, and horses will be combed x times a week.

At the end, add up all the times the individual animal has done the actions and display the data.
